1. Problem Statement: Children’s Card Game

After your success with creating a toy solar system, you receive an invitation from a toy company, “Wizards of the Rich!”. The company needs your help to create a children’s card game. But this company has no experience making one before (but that does not stop them because they want cash money). So, you decide to make a simple card game for them.

1.1 Gameplay

In your prototype, a player duels a fixed opponent who never plays any card, which means most of the card functions will only be used by the player.

1.1.1 Game Component

1.Player Character Card

– At the start of the game, each player will have a default character as an avatar. You choose Player Character before you choose your deck.

Each has different stats of:

– Life Point = if Life Point of the character in played reaches 0, the corresponding player loses the game.

– Attack Point = The amount of damage this card deals to the opponent when attacking.

– Defense Point = The amount of damage this card reduces when defending against an opponent’s attack.

2.Deck

– Contains as many cards as you want, you can insert and remove any card at the card shop. However, you can only have up to 4 of the same cards.

3. Card

3.1 Character Card

– Similar to player character, Character card contains Life Point, Attack Point, and Defense Point.

Player can choose to perform 1 of 2 actions when playing this card.

1. Switch Character

– All of current character’s equipped items will be retired. – Replace current character in play with this card.

– Remaining Life Point percentage from previous character will be transfered to new character. (Ex Current character LP = 75/100 -&gt; New character = 112/150) 2. Sacrifice

– With the cost of this card, you can increase current character Life Point (by percentage). Different types of card increase different percentage of Life Point.

3.1.1 Basic Character Card

– Character card with only switch and sacrifice actions.

– Sacrificing it heals the current character for 1/6 of the current character’s max LP.

3.1.2 Main Character Card

– Character card that can level up when this card is in play and Player uses the same card. Level up increases all 3 of character stats. – Sacrificing it heals the current character for 1/8 of current character’s max LP.

3.1.3 Exodia Character Card

– Character card that when equip with 4 Exodia Part Cards (Item Card), Player will immediately win the game.

– Sacrificing it heals the current character for 1/10 of the current character’s max LP.

3.2 Item Card

– Item Card is used to increase character stats, it contains LP bonus, Attack bonus, and Defense bonus.

– Item Card only has 1 action when played, equip item, which increases the current character’s stats. Character can have any number of item cards equipped, but all equipped item cards will be lost when player switches character.

3.2.1 Basic Item Card

– Item card with only previously mentioned function.

3.2.2 Exodia Part Card

– Item card that only increases character Defense Point, if this card is equipped on to Exodia Character Card, Defense Point increase will be doubled.

1.1.2 Game Flow

At the start of the game, the player shuffles his deck and draw 5 cards. A player character card is played as a placeholder character.

1.Start with the player turn, the player draws a card.

2.Player chooses to play one card and pick its action.

3.Player character automatically attacks opponent character:

– Damage dealt = Attacker’s Total Attack Point – Defender’s Total Defense Point

(Damage can’t be negative)

4.Start the opponent turn, opponent character automatically attacks player character.

5.Repeat until win condition is met by either player.

2. Implementation Details:

To complete this assignment, you need to understand about Abstract Classes and Junit Test Cases.

To test your understanding about abstraction, we will not provide class diagram for this assignment, and we will not indicate which methods and classes are abstract. Try your best to figure out. There are three abstract classes and three abstract methods.

There are five packages in the provided files: application, player, card, deck and test.

You will be implementing most of the class in the card and deck package (Every class is partly given, while PremadeDeck class doesn’t need to be modified).

There are some test cases given in package test.student. These will help test your code whether it will be able to run or not. However, some conditions are not tested in these test cases. Look for those conditions in the class details. You must create your own test cases for such cases.

You can define any additional number of private (but not public, protected or package) fields and methods in addition to the fields and methods specified below. You are encouraged to try to group your logic into private methods to reduce duplicate code as much as possible.

* Noted that Access Modifier Notations can be listed below + (public), # (protected), – (private)

2.1 package deck

1.1.3 Class: Deck

This class represents a deck player will used. Deck has 3 attributes: name, deckSize, and deckList. Player can assign deck to use in gameplay. Deck can only have at most 4 of the same cards.

– name = name of the deck

– deckSize = number of cards the deck contains, need to change when Deck is created, when card is inserted into the Deck, and when card is removed from the Deck.

2.1.1.1 Constructors

+ Deck(String name, Card[] deckList) Construct a Deck object with the given name , deckList, and initialize deckSize to be the same size as the given deckList.

(Hint: You should use Array (Card[]) to implement inventory.).

2.1.1.2 Methods

+ int insertCard(Card card) throws InsertCardFailedException Insert the given card into the bottom of card list (Recommend: create a new copy of deckList array with one more slot) and modify deckSize to be accurate to the new deckList.

Throw an InsertCardFailedException with message “You can only put 4 of the same cards into the deck” if there are already 4 of the same card in the deck. Otherwise, return the new deckSize. (Given, but can be changed or adjusted according to how you code insert card).

Hint: You can use isEqual(Card othercard) method

from Class card.

+ Card removeCard(int slotNumber) throws RemoveCardFailedException Unequip a card in the given slot number from the deck, rearrange the card from every slot after it to replace the empty slot. Modify deckSize to be accurate to the new deckList, and return the removed card.

Throw an RemoveCardFailedException with message “Number you insert exceed deck size” when the slotNumber is greater than or equal to deckSize. (Already Implemented)

+ String toString() You do not have to edit this method.

+ int Card[] getDeckList()

+ int String getName()

+ int getDeckSize() Getter methods.

+ void setDeckSize(int deckSize) Setter method.

2.2 package card.base

2.2.1 Class Card

This class is the base class of all cards in the card shop. Each card has its own name and description. Card should never be instantiated into objects, as it is only designed to be a base class so that consumer classes (like Deck) can easily use their subclasses.

2.2.1.1 Constructors

+ Card(String name, String Description) Initialize the card with the given name and description.

2.2.1.2 Methods

+ String toString() this method should never be called with from this card, it can only be called from subclasses.

+ String getName()

+ String getDescription() Getter methods.

This class is a base class of character card, used as an avatar for player to use in gameplay. It has lifePoint, attackPoint, and defensePoint. It provides shared implementation of displaying names across all upgradable items. CharacterCard should never be instantiated to objects, as it is only designed to be a base class so that consumer classes (like the Deck and Player) can easily use their subclasses.

2.2.2.1 Constructors

+ CharacterCard (String name, String Description , int lifePoint, int attackPoint, int defensePoint) Initialize the character card with the given name , description, lifePoint, attackPoint, and defensePoint.

2.2.2.2 Methods

Use setNewCharacterLifePoint(int)

,setAttack(int)

, setDefense (int)

, setAssignedCharacter (CharacterCard) from Player class.

setNewCharacterLifePoint already uses percentage calculation. It will change current life point from player’s previous life point already. You can simply insert lifepoint into this method.

+ int sacrifice(Player player) Called when using CharacterCard to increase player life point. Life point gain is different for each class this method should never be called from this class. It can only be called from subclasses.

+ String toString() You do not have to edit this method.

2.2.3 Class ItemCard

This class is a base class of item card, a player can equip item to increase lifePoint, attackPoint, and/or defensePoint. It has lpBonus, attackBonus, and defenseBonus. It provides shared implementation of displaying names across all item cards. ItemCard should never be instantiated to objects, as it is only designed to be a base class so that consumer classes (like the Deck and Player) can easily use their subclasses.

2.2.2.1 Constructors

+ ItemCard(String name, String description, int lpBonus , int attackBonus, int Initialize the item card with the given name ,description, lpBonus, attackBonus, and

defenseBonus) defenseBonus

2.3.3 Class MainCharacterCard

This class represents “main character card”. Very similar to CharacterCard but with 2 more properties and 3 more methods. Main character start with level 0. If a player currently plays main character card, it can levelUp, which increases level by 1 and increases player stats equal to levelUpBonus multiplier. (levelUp can be done by playing the same card as the main character card, but you don’t have to implement that part).

– int level = current level of this character, start with 0 when initialized

– float levelUpBonus = stat increase multiplier when levelUp,

Ex: If levelUpBonus = 0.3, when levelUp, player lifePoint, attackPoint, and defensePoint increase by 30% (round down to int)

2.3.3.1 Constructors

+ MainCharacterCard (String name, String description, int lifePoint, int attackPoint, int defensePoint, float levelUpBonus) Initialize the main character card with the given name, description, levelUpBonus, and the attribute.

Player is healed equal to 1/10 of player maxLifePoint. Hint:

Use getMaxLifePoint() , healPlayer(int) from Player class

+ boolean winConditionCheck(ItemCard[] inventory)

Hint:

Use instanceof to check if ItemCard is

Called to check if the inventory contains 4 or more ExodiaPartCard. Return true if it has 4 or more, false otherwise.

ExodiaPartCard

2.3.5 Class ExodiaPartCard

This class represents “exodia items card” Exodia is an ItemCard with: description = “Assemble 4 of Exodia part card to win the game” lifeBonus = 0 attackBonus = 0

name and defenseBonus depends on initialization
